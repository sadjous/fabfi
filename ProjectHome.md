**Tech Summary**

FabFi is a user-extensible, long range, point-to-point and mesh hybrid-wireless broadband transmission infrastructure. It is based on the simple idea that a network of simple, intelligent, interconnected devices can create reliable networks in unstable environments. We use simple physics to make low-cost devices communicate directionally for very long distances (physics is cool!), and flexible configurations to adapt to a large variety of conditions.

Fabfi differs from most mesh platforms because it is specifically designed for high performance across multiple hops using paired or multi-radio devices.  The system auto-manages the routing of traffic to maintain full-duplex transmission across hops whenever possible.

Starting with version 4.0 (the first version migrated to this site) Fabfi also supports wifi connections direct to end-users, bandwidth accounting and access control with a cloud-based management server.

Fabfi is currently being deployed live in Afghanistan, Kenya and the United States.
