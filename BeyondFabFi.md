# Free Edu Net #

**Free Edu Net** is a proposed free-of-charge wireless mesh intranet and educational content server.  It is  sustained by a for-fee connection through the same infrastructure to the world wide web and/or paid content on the local server.  The content server uses the internet connection to keep educational content like wikipedia, open courseware, etc. up to date.

The proposed first deployment is in Herat, Afghanistan and is hoped to be concurrent with a large OLPC XO laptop deployment.
