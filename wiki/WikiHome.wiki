== Welcome to the [http://fabfi.fabfolk.com FabFi] Project ==

FabFi is a free software platform deigned to enable individuals and local communities to build wireless broadband infrastructure using off-the-shelf, commodity wifi gear.  FabFi provides all the tools to:

 # Build a city-scale mesh network backbone with long and short range links
 # Provide wifi access direct to clients without CPE
 # Manage access control and bill customers by multiple methods (any day now)
 # Monitor network performance and utilization

The FabFi team also runs a network management and billing server in the cloud that network operators can use to manage and bill their networks instead of building their own server from scratch.

_NOTE: This Wiki is designed to help anyone with some computer experience to build a fabfi network.  As such, we deliberately build from base principles and provide additional explanations whenever possible.  We apologize if this is a little tedious for more advanced users._
