#summary FabFi 5.0 Test Bed


= Overview =

The FabFi 5.0 Test Bed ... will come online in late August 2011.  (Tentatively in a working session held in Cape Town, South Africa).  

The purpose of the testbed is to implement and test in microcosm all the functional and architectural components of FF5.

Its permanent location is TBD.

= Node Configuration =


*T-Node:*
  * 1 - PowerAP-N (OpenWRT), serving clients @2.4G 
  * 1+ - !NanostationM5-Loco (AirOS), connecting to other T-Nodes
  * 1+ - !NanostationM5-Loco (AirOS), connecting to C-Node Mesh
  * Note: there is no easy all-PassivePOE solution for T-Nodes as !RouterStation Pros are 48V and !RouterStations Need more Switchports

T-Node Design Consideration: If Servers include wifi, PowerAP can talk to server wirelessly.

*C-Node:*
  * 1 - PowerAP-N (OpenWRT), serving clients AND adhoc mesh @2.4G NB: Assumes: AP+adhoc functional in OpenWRT *ANTOINE: TEST*
  * 1 - !NanostationM5-Loco (AirOS), connecting to T-Node
  * (option) 1 - !PicostationM2-HP (AirOS), connects to other C-Nodes in an adhoc mesh instead of radio reuse on PowerAP-N

*Power*



= Proposed Architecture =

 * Core
  * 4 T-nodes
   * Primary uplink with content server and RADIUS master
   * Secondary uplink
   * Non-uplinked content server
   * Plain T-node
 * Local Mesh
  * 5 C-nodes

== Outstanding issues ==

 * Configuration
  * need auto-config for devices with 3 radios (5Gmesh, adhoc, client access)
  * Unsure about adhoc radio config.  What about BSSID?  (Isn't IBSS defined by BSSID and SSID irrelevant?)
  * dev mode with limited power
 * Mesh Navigation 
  * Current behavior allows navigation between OLSR *most* nodes via IPv6 addresses, however hops across batman nodes do not always route.  Example:  ff92 will not ping 94, but 82 will ping 94.  (topology: 92-82 - - - 84-94).
  * BATMAN nodes are visible via ipv4 as long as you don't have to cross an adhoc 2.4G network.  (ex: from 90, you can ping 10.100.0.80-81, but not 82)
  * preferred behavior:  
   * Minimum:  reliable IPv6 nav to all olsr nodes regardless of path, with clear method of determining the other devices in the path as needed (to find failures)
   * Preferred: IPv6 OR IPv4 (as able) nav working on all devices (every device can reach every other one).  
 * DNS
  * Network currently doesn't automate DNS advertisement (nameservice not working?)
 * Routing
  * Traffic appears routed, not forwarded in the network.  This causes problems with identifying origins.  (ex:  all traffic to the squid appears as if its origin is the headnode.  Prefer to see client-level origin addresses).
  * want to be able to see requests by IP at squid.  
 * Diagnostics:
  * nano/pico signal meters do not currently work.  Should show infrastructure connections (as opposed to clients)
  * Map updates are not occurring (maybe not implemented?)
  * can't netcat from txtinfo plugin :(.
 * Performance testing:
  * be able to iperf between any two devices
 * Performance Concerns
  * there are some speed issues I haven't been able to diagnose yet. 

unable to easily navigate between different types of devices (transparent/otherwise).  OLSR nodes use IPv6
