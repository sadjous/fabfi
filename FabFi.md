# What's a FabFi? #

FabFi is an open-source, FabLab-grown system using common building materials and off-the-shelf electronics to transmit wireless ethernet signals across distances of up to several miles.

With Fabfi, communities can build their own wireless networks to gain high-speed internet connectivity - thus enabling them to access online educational, medical, and other resources. FabFi teams up with Afrimesh which provides a dashboard solution for network management under a codename **JoinAfrica**.

So far, FabFi has been implemented in Kenya (Mtn. View district around Nairobi, and at the ARO Fab Lab in Majiwa), as well as in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.
