#Global FabFi Deployments



# Existing / Permanent #

**NB: the definition of a "node" changes from fabfi 3.0 and earlier to fabfi 4.0.  In fabfi 3.0 "node"=="wireless device". Because wifi is now provided direct to the user without a dedicated device, more users are able to connect with fewer nodes, however each node can consist of multiple wireless devices**
